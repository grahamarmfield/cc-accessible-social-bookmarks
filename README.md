==============================

Accessible social bookmarking plugin for WordPress

Includes social bookmarking into pages and posts on WordPress websites.

There are configuration options to allow positioning of bookmark icons and which post types to use them with.

Accessibility is catered for by clear alternate text for the image links, a good focus visibility, and a 
warning to site visitors if clicking on the icons opens a new window.
